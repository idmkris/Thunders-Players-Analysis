For the front end, I would use Angular or React for their responsive UI/UX. Mobile versions also need to be taken care of as coaches tend to carry portable devices. The core of the system responsible for handling user requests, game data, and real-time updates; I would build the backend using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for real-time communication. To store historical game statistics and other relevant data, I would use PostgreSQL for the database. Real-time data, such as current game statistics, would be stored in a NoSQL database like Redis for quick access. I would use WebSockets to provide real-time updates to users. Users can subscribe to live games, and the system would push updates to them when events occur during the game. To handle concurrent users efficiently, I would use AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple server instances. This ensures that the system can handle up to 100 simultaneous users and can be scaled horizontally to handle more users if needed. For better user experience, I can implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times. Redis would serve as both a cache and a real-time data store. JWT would be used for user authentication and authorization as users may have different permission levels to access the data. Docker would be used for containerization to enable easy deployment and scaling of the application.


A larger user base might cause several following issues. First of all, the server and database would need to be scaled up to accommodate a larger user base. More server instances might need to be added and the load balancer mentioned above would also be necessary for even distribution of traffic. In terms of database, PostgreSQL may face some challenges when it comes to a massive number of concurrent connections. In this case, NoSQL might be used for its scalability. Optimization would also need to be done to ensure efficient event broadcasting. Another issue is the data consistency across distributed systems, which is even worse in real-time scenarios and needs to be taken care of with consistency models. At the same time, strong security measures need to be adopted to protect user data in a large scale application.Last but not least, Handling 10,000 users simultaneously may result in increased infrastructure costs. Proper monitoring and optimization of resources are crucial to managing expenses.
